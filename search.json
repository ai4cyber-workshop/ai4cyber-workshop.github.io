Moreover, the hasty integration of LLM components into existing \n  software across the board created new, vast, and poorly understood attack surfaces. \n  \n  As the defensive and offensive teams are locked in an arms race to best leverage the arrival of \n  LLMs and genAI to their advantage in the ever-changing threat and mitigation landscape, a clear \n  winner is yet to emerge. The goal of this keynote is to leverage current and prior research at \n  the intersection of cybersecurity and GenAI to gain insight into what the future might hold and \n  how either side can still impact it.\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      Yufei Han\n      INRIA Rennes\n      Senior Researcher\n    \n  \n  Keynote 2: Can we really use LLM on edge devices for trustable, explainable and accurate malicious code detection: Theory and Practices \n  Abstract: Deployable Large Language \n  models (1B to 7B parameters) work on consumer-available hardware, and their understanding of language can be of \n  great use to Powershell malware detection and explanation. \n  \n  However, such goal is prevented by their lacking of capacity due to the low number of parameters, being outmatched \n  by large models (especially for those &gt; 70B parameters). Our exploration aims to investigate how to reduce this gap \n  through the compression of domain knowledge in textual form, thus being includeable into prompts to enhance \n  deteciton and explanations. Thus, we develop GRAIL, a Powershell knowledge graph expressed as questions that \n  LLMs can answer while reviewing input Powershell samples. While providing guidance to the model with domain \n  knowledge, GRAIL acts as a plug-and-play enhancer that provide small LLMs runnable on edge devices with \n  capabilities comparable with their larger and more powerful counterparts, avoiding the needs of cost-intensive \n  re-training from scratch. Also, we highlight how the inclusion of GRAIL in prompts outmatches both fine-tuning \n  and chain-of-thoughts techniques, hence acting as a single action to be taken at deployment time. \n  \n  In parallel, our study also dives into adversarial robustness of the LLMs in analyzing codes. We show that \n  code refracting may change the reasoning out from LLMs, yet without changing malicious functionalities \n  programmed. This study demonstrates the risk of using LLM for security-critical applications, such as \n  malware classification. On the other hand, this work paves the way towards how we can improve accordingly \n  the robustness of LLM for code analysis."
